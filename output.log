misuse and identity theft have been a priority in our oversight efforts.', 'SSA OIG has established a multidisciplinary team of professionals that develop and implement innovative approaches to combat identity theft and scams through audits, criminal investigations and prosecution, civil enforcement, public outreach, and education.', 'Our SSN misuse investigations encompass a range of fraud schemes.', 'Synthetic identity theft is one of the more troubling forms of identity theft and has been a focus of some of our recent investigations.', 'SSA OIG has specific authority to investigate SSN misuse violations under Title 42 U.S.C. §408.', 'Additionally, based on shared jurisdiction, we also assist in addressing identity fraud by conducting investigations related to violations under Title 18 U.S.C. § 1028.', 'SSA OIG has never received dedicated funding for pandemic oversight.', 'SSA OIG continues to make data-driven decisions to prioritize these workloads.', 'SSA OIG Office of Audit (OA) is a key player in identifying vulnerabilities in SSA programs and operations that may result in identity theft.', 'Our audits found fraudsters may steal identities to work or to claim earnings-related benefits.', 'For example, in one audit, we found fraudsters improperly used the SSNs of 37 older adults to acquire $4.6 million during a five-year period.', 'During the same timeframe, OA found fraudsters misused 817 SSNs of deceased individuals to earn approximately $29 million in wages.', 'In another audit, we reported SSA removed from its Master Earnings File $742 million in self-employment earnings originally reported on approximately 50,000 numberholders’ Federal income tax returns during a four-year period.', 'In approximately 59 percent of those cases, SSA removed the earnings because the numberholders alleged other individuals stole their identities and used their SSNs to file fraudulent tax returns.', 'At our request, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) determined tax filers had used the self-employment earnings to claim the earned income tax credit.', 'Another focus of our audit work examines the Internet services the SSA offers.', 'SSN numberholders can create my Social Security accounts to transact business with SSA, including reviewing their earnings records or changing their direct deposit information.', 'In January 2013, SSA began allowing individuals to change their direct deposit bank information using the my Social Security Internet application.', 'Shortly thereafter, SSA and the OIG began receiving allegations of fraud related to unauthorized changes.', 'Our audits found from January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries by making unauthorized direct deposit changes through my Social Security.', 'Fortunately, an additional $23.9 million to 19,662 beneficiaries was prevented from misdirection because SSA corrected the unauthorized direct deposit changes before a payment was released.', 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA closed its field offices to the public, resulting in a dramatic increase in the utilization of SSA’s online services.', 'As the use of eServices increased, so did the opportunity for fraudsters to manipulate SSA’s online platforms.', 'Scammers use stolen personable identifiable information (PII) to file fraudulent online applications, establish or take over online accounts, or redirect benefit payments to alternate bank accounts.', 'Since the start of Fiscal Year 2021, OIG has received more than 41,000 eServices-related allegations, including fraud schemes that misuse or are facilitated by SSA’s online platforms, such as my Social Security.', 'It is critical SSA employ effective controls to obtain sufficient assurance users of its online services are who they claim to be.', 'Additionally, bad actors exploited some of SSA’s public-facing systems to validate SSNs and potentially use that information to commit identity fraud.', 'As more Americans utilize online platforms, fraud schemes will increase.', 'Our OI is currently developing an OIG-wide strategy to address identity theft related to eServices, including the analysis of real-time agency data to proactively identify the potential fraud.', 'In addition to investigating identity theft related to eServices for prosecution purposes, OI also identifies vulnerabilities in systems and processes and reports them timely to SSA.', 'Beyond eServices, our OI also receives and evaluates allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in SSA’s programs and operations, and takes appropriate action in coordination with federal, state, and local prosecutors on matters of SSN fraud.', 'This work has led to many successful convictions.', 'SSA OIG and the FBI arrested five individuals pursuant to an indictment from the Northern District of Georgia.', 'The indictment resulted from an investigation led by SSA OIG investigators that uncovered a telephone imposter scam originating from overseas call centers.', 'The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a new tool to create official-looking deception scam messages intending to steal personal information.', 'AI will utilize algorithms that can recognize, summarize, and generate fraudulent texts and contents based on massive datasets.', 'AI can even generate scam messages and produce a transcript in which a scammer impersonates federal government employees.', 'SSA OIG is working towards countering AI-generated scams and educating Social Security recipients of AI-generated scams.', 'The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in criminals finding ways to fraudulently take advantage of the infusion of trillions of dollars in federal funding.', 'SSN misuse, including identity theft, is a common thread running through many investigations related to the misuse of pandemic relief funds.', 'Since the start of the pandemic, SSA OIG has participated in the National COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Taskforce.', 'SSA OIG has issued nearly a dozen COVID-19-related audits.', 'SSA OIG and collaborated in joint investigations working with federal, state, and local law enforcement entities to pursue SSN misuse and other crimes involving federal pandemic relief funds including Unemployment Insurance (UI) fraud and PPP fraud.', 'Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA OIG has received over 31,740 fraud allegations referencing Pandemic-related relief programs and funds.', 'At present, we have over 70 active investigations involving COVID-19 pandemic fraud.', 'Our investigative efforts to date, both solely and in joint investigations with our law enforcement partners, have resulted in 32 defendants convicted, over $34 million in identified fraud loss, court-ordered restitution of over $24 million, and over $6.5 million in funds recovered.', 'In FY 2023, SSA OIG anticipates expending approximately $2.3 million on Pandemic-related investigative workloads and audits.', 'I want to thank the Subcommittee for inviting me today to highlight the SSA OIG’s oversight and outreach efforts in combatting and preventing the misuse of SSNs.']

misuse and identity theft have been a priority in our oversight efforts.', 'SSA OIG has established a multidisciplinary team of professionals that develop and implement innovative approaches to combat identity theft and scams through audits, criminal investigations and prosecution, civil enforcement, public outreach, and education.', 'Our SSN misuse investigations encompass a range of fraud schemes.', 'Synthetic identity theft is one of the more troubling forms of identity theft and has been a focus of some of our recent investigations.', 'SSA OIG has specific authority to investigate SSN misuse violations under Title 42 U.S.C. §408.', 'Additionally, based on shared jurisdiction, we also assist in addressing identity fraud by conducting investigations related to violations under Title 18 U.S.C. § 1028.', 'SSA OIG has never received dedicated funding for pandemic oversight.', 'SSA OIG continues to make data-driven decisions to prioritize these workloads.', 'SSA OIG Office of Audit (OA) is a key player in identifying vulnerabilities in SSA programs and operations that may result in identity theft.', 'Our audits found fraudsters may steal identities to work or to claim earnings-related benefits.', 'For example, in one audit, we found fraudsters improperly used the SSNs of 37 older adults to acquire $4.6 million during a five-year period.', 'During the same timeframe, OA found fraudsters misused 817 SSNs of deceased individuals to earn approximately $29 million in wages.', 'In another audit, we reported SSA removed from its Master Earnings File $742 million in self-employment earnings originally reported on approximately 50,000 numberholders’ Federal income tax returns during a four-year period.', 'In approximately 59 percent of those cases, SSA removed the earnings because the numberholders alleged other individuals stole their identities and used their SSNs to file fraudulent tax returns.', 'At our request, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) determined tax filers had used the self-employment earnings to claim the earned income tax credit.', 'Another focus of our audit work examines the Internet services the SSA offers.', 'SSN numberholders can create my Social Security accounts to transact business with SSA, including reviewing their earnings records or changing their direct deposit information.', 'In January 2013, SSA began allowing individuals to change their direct deposit bank information using the my Social Security Internet application.', 'Shortly thereafter, SSA and the OIG began receiving allegations of fraud related to unauthorized changes.', 'Our audits found from January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries by making unauthorized direct deposit changes through my Social Security.', 'Fortunately, an additional $23.9 million to 19,662 beneficiaries was prevented from misdirection because SSA corrected the unauthorized direct deposit changes before a payment was released.', 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA closed its field offices to the public, resulting in a dramatic increase in the utilization of SSA’s online services.', 'As the use of eServices increased, so did the opportunity for fraudsters to manipulate SSA’s online platforms.', 'Scammers use stolen personable identifiable information (PII) to file fraudulent online applications, establish or take over online accounts, or redirect benefit payments to alternate bank accounts.', 'Since the start of Fiscal Year 2021, OIG has received more than 41,000 eServices-related allegations, including fraud schemes that misuse or are facilitated by SSA’s online platforms, such as my Social Security.', 'It is critical SSA employ effective controls to obtain sufficient assurance users of its online services are who they claim to be.', 'Additionally, bad actors exploited some of SSA’s public-facing systems to validate SSNs and potentially use that information to commit identity fraud.', 'As more Americans utilize online platforms, fraud schemes will increase.', 'Our OI is currently developing an OIG-wide strategy to address identity theft related to eServices, including the analysis of real-time agency data to proactively identify the potential fraud.', 'In addition to investigating identity theft related to eServices for prosecution purposes, OI also identifies vulnerabilities in systems and processes and reports them timely to SSA.', 'Beyond eServices, our OI also receives and evaluates allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in SSA’s programs and operations, and takes appropriate action in coordination with federal, state, and local prosecutors on matters of SSN fraud.', 'This work has led to many successful convictions.', 'SSA OIG and the FBI arrested five individuals pursuant to an indictment from the Northern District of Georgia.', 'The indictment resulted from an investigation led by SSA OIG investigators that uncovered a telephone imposter scam originating from overseas call centers.', 'The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a new tool to create official-looking deception scam messages intending to steal personal information.', 'AI will utilize algorithms that can recognize, summarize, and generate fraudulent texts and contents based on massive datasets.', 'AI can even generate scam messages and produce a transcript in which a scammer impersonates federal government employees.', 'SSA OIG is working towards countering AI-generated scams and educating Social Security recipients of AI-generated scams.', 'The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in criminals finding ways to fraudulently take advantage of the infusion of trillions of dollars in federal funding.', 'SSN misuse, including identity theft, is a common thread running through many investigations related to the misuse of pandemic relief funds.', 'Since the start of the pandemic, SSA OIG has participated in the National COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Taskforce.', 'SSA OIG has issued nearly a dozen COVID-19-related audits.', 'SSA OIG and collaborated in joint investigations working with federal, state, and local law enforcement entities to pursue SSN misuse and other crimes involving federal pandemic relief funds including Unemployment Insurance (UI) fraud and PPP fraud.', 'Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA OIG has received over 31,740 fraud allegations referencing Pandemic-related relief programs and funds.', 'At present, we have over 70 active investigations involving COVID-19 pandemic fraud.', 'Our investigative efforts to date, both solely and in joint investigations with our law enforcement partners, have resulted in 32 defendants convicted, over $34 million in identified fraud loss, court-ordered restitution of over $24 million, and over $6.5 million in funds recovered.', 'In FY 2023, SSA OIG anticipates expending approximately $2.3 million on Pandemic-related investigative workloads and audits.', 'I want to thank the Subcommittee for inviting me today to highlight the SSA OIG’s oversight and outreach efforts in combatting and preventing the misuse of SSNs.']
