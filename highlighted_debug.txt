A
 
Gallup
 
survey
 
in
 
September
 
showed
 
that
 
48
%
 
of
 
adults
 
rated
 
economic
 
conditions
 
as
 
'
poor
,
'
 
the
 
highest
 
share
 
in
 
a
 
year
.
A
 
University
 
of
 
Michigan
 
monthly
 
survey
 
of
 
attitudes
 
toward
 
the
 
economy
 
found
 
that
 
20
%
 
of
 
consumers
 
expressed
 
that
 
their
 
personal
 
finances
 
had
 
deteriorated
 
between
 
Biden
’
s
 
inauguration
 
and
 
September
 
of
 
this
 
year
.
More
 
meaningful
 
to
 
Americans
 
than
 
the
 
overall
 
economic
 
growth
 
that
 
Biden
 
celebrates
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
stubborn
 
reality
 
that
 
average
 
food
 
prices
 
in
 
U
.
S
.
 
cities
 
have
 
risen
 
20
%
 
since
 
Biden
 
took
 
office
.
Or
 
that
 
the
 
average
 
price
 
for
 
a
 
gallon
 
of
 
gas
 
is
 
$
3
.
44
 
—
 
less
 
than
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
but
 
still
 
about
 
one
-
third
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
pre
