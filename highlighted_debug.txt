But
 
as
 
Russia
 
has
 
seized
 
territory
 
in
 
Ukraine
’
s
 
east
 
and
 
south
,
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
the
 
country
’
s
 
critical
 
raw
 
materials
 
has
 
been
 
thrown
 
into
 
question
.

raw
 
materials
 
on
 
Ukrainian
 
land
 
will
 
redound
 
to
 
Russia

s
 
benefits
,
 
allowing
 
the
 
Kremlin
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
materials
 
off
 
world
 
markets
.
International
 
investors
 
might
 
seek
 
less
 
risky
 
alternatives
.
 
that
 
will
 
translate
 
into
 
mines
 
and
 
infrastructure
 
in
 
places
 
other
 
than
 
Ukraine
 
and
 
greatly
 
undermine
 
Ukraine
’
s
 
ability
 
in
 
the
 
future
 
to
 
compete
 
in
 
the
 
critical
 
raw
 
materials
 
market
.
The
 
demining
 
process
 
alone
 
will
 
take
 
approximately
 
ten
 
years
 
according
 
to
 
Ukrainian
 
officials
.
the
 
estimated
 
$
138
 
billion
 
worth
 
of
 
damage
 
caused
 
so
 
far
 
by
 
Russian
 
strikes
