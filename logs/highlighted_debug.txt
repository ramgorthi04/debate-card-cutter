neither
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
Social
 
Security
 
nor
 
the
 
federal
 
government
â€™
s
 
ability
 
to
 
bear
 
that
 
cost
 
change
 
very
 
much
 
when
 
Social
 
Security
 
becomes
 
insolvent
.
The
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
changes
 
is
 
that
 
Social
 
Security
 
would
 
no
 
longer
 
have
 
the
 
legal
 
right
 
to
 
call
 
upon
 
federal
 
resources
 
over
 
and
 
above
 
its
 
own
 
dedicated
 
taxes
.
Continuing
 
such
 
transfers
 
would
 
prevent
 
a
 
20
 
percent
 
across
-
the
-
board
 
cut
 
in
 
Social
 
Security
 
benefits
,
 
hardly
 
a
 
trivial
 
matter
.
But
 
neither
 
of
 
these
 
important
 
facts
 
should
 
lead
 
observers
 
to
 
conclude
 
that
 
the
 
insolvency
 
of
 
Social
 
Security
 
would
 
in
 
fact
 
lead
 
to
 
massive
 
benefit
 
cuts
 
or
 
an
 
increased
 
financial
 
burden
 
on
 
the
 
federal
 
government
 
as
 
a
 
whole
.
