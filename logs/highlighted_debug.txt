Recent
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
IMF
’
s
 
Currency
 
Composition
 
of
 
Official
 
Foreign
 
Exchange
 
Reserves
 
(
COFER
)
 
point
 
to
 
an
 
ongoing
 
gradual
 
decline
 
in
 
the
 
dollar
’
s
 
share
 
of
 
allocated
 
foreign
 
reserves
 
of
 
central
 
banks
 
and
 
governments
.
Rather
,
 
it
 
has
 
been
 
accompanied
 
by
 
a
 
rise
 
in
 
the
 
share
 
of
 
what
 
we
 
have
 
called
 
nontraditional
 
reserve
 
currencies
,
 
including
 
the
 
Australian
 
dollar
,
 
Canadian
 
dollar
,
 
Chinese
 
renminbi
,
 
South
 
Korean
 
won
,
 
Singaporean
 
dollar
,
 
and
 
the
 
Nordic
 
currencies
.
These
 
nontraditional
 
reserve
 
currencies
 
are
 
attractive
 
to
 
reserve
 
managers
 
because
 
they
 
provide
 
diversification
 
and
 
relatively
 
attractive
 
yields
,
 
and
 
because
 
they
 
have
 
become
 
increasingly
 
easy
 
to
 
buy
,
 
sell
 
and
 
hold
 
with
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
new
 
digital
 
financial
 
technologies
 
(
such
 
as
 
automatic
 
market
-
making
 
and
 
automated
 
liquidity
 
management
 
systems
)
.
Taking
 
a
 
longer
 
view
,
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
decades
,
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
US
 
dollar
 
has
 
been
 
broadly
 
unchanged
,
 
while
 
the
 
US
 
dollar
’
s
 
share
 
of
 
global
 
reserves
 
has
 
declined
,
 
indicates
 
that
 
central
 
banks
 
have
 
indeed
 
been
 
shifting
 
gradually
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
dollar
.
One
 
nontraditional
 
reserve
 
currency
 
gaining
 
market
 
share
 
is
 
the
 
Chinese
 
renminbi
,
 
whose
 
gains
 
match
 
a
 
quarter
 
of
 
the
 
decline
 
in
 
the
 
dollar
’
s
 
share
.
In
 
our
 
2022
 
paper
,
 
we
 
identified
 
46
 
active
 
diversifiers
,
 
defined
 
as
 
countries
 
with
 
a
 
share
 
of
 
foreign
 
exchange
 
reserves
 
in
 
nontraditional
 
currencies
 
of
 
at
 
least
 
5
 
percent
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2020
.
By
 
2023
,
 
at
 
least
 
three
 
more
 
countries
 
(
Israel
,
 
Netherlands
,
 
Seychelles
)
 
have
 
joined
 
this
 
list
.
