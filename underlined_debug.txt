In
 
a
 
September
 
focus
 
group
 
with
 
Pennsylvania
 
swing
 
voters
,
 
one
 
participant
 
told
 
the
 
research
 
firm
 
Engagious
 
that
 
the
 
concept
 
was
 
a
 
“
jumbled
 
mess
,
”
 
adding
 
that
 
“
it
’
s
 
really
 
hard
 
to
 
explain
.
”
The
 
trouble
 
is
,
 
people
 
aren
’
t
 
buying
 
it
.
Just
 
as
 
the
 
phrase
 
hasn
’
t
 
caught
 
on
 
despite
 
a
 
low
 
jobless
 
rate
,
 
the
 
underlying
 
policies
 
that
 
Bidenomics
 
purports
 
to
 
describe
 
have
 
left
 
voters
 
cold
,
 
polling
 
shows
.
A
 
Gallup
 
survey
 
in
 
September
 
showed
 
that
 
48
%
 
of
 
adults
 
rated
 
economic
 
conditions
 
as
 
“
poor
,
”
 
the
 
highest
 
share
 
in
 
a
 
year
.
A
 
University
 
of
 
Michigan
 
monthly
 
survey
 
of
 
attitudes
 
toward
 
the
 
economy
 
found
 
that
 
20
%
 
of
 
consumers
 
expressed
 
that
 
their
 
personal
 
finances
 
had
 
deteriorated
 
between
 
Biden
’
s
 
inauguration
 
and
 
September
 
of
 
this
 
year
.
More
 
meaningful
 
to
 
Americans
 
than
 
the
 
overall
 
economic
 
growth
 
that
 
Biden
 
celebrates
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
stubborn
 
reality
 
that
 
average
 
food
 
prices
 
in
 
U
.
S
.
 
cities
 
have
 
risen
 
20
%
 
since
 
Biden
 
took
 
office
.
Or
 
that
 
the
 
average
 
price
 
for
 
a
 
gallon
 
of
 
gas
 
is
 
$
3
.
44
 
—
 
less
 
than
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
year
 
ago
 
but
 
still
 
about
 
one
-
third
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
pre
-
pandemic
 
level
.
Inflation
 
has
 
been
 
cooling
,
 
down
 
from
 
a
 
40
-
year
-
high
 
of
 
9
%
 
last
 
year
 
to
 
less
 
than
 
4
%
,
 
but
 
memories
 
of
 
high
 
prices
 
remain
 
all
 
too
 
fresh
,
 
economists
 
say
.
They
 
want
 
their
 
old
 
prices
 
back
.
“
The
 
people
 
that
 
he
 
[
Biden
]
 
stands
 
for
 
don
’
t
 
deal
 
with
 
economics
,
”
 
added
 
Clyburn
,
 
whose
 
endorsement
 
of
 
Biden
 
before
 
the
 
2020
 
Democratic
 
primary
 
in
 
South
 
Carolina
 
revived
 
his
 
candidacy
 
and
 
propelled
 
him
 
to
 
the
 
party
 
nomination
.
Speaking
 
to
 
reporters
 
recently
 
on
 
his
 
campaign
 
bus
 
in
 
New
 
Hampshire
,
 
Phillips
 
said
 
that
 
“
people
 
are
 
suffering
 
and
 
they
 
don
'
t
 
give
 
a
 
hoot
 
about
 
monikers
 
and
 
names
 
and
 
taglines
.
